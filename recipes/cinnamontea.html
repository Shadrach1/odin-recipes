    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have been drinking te de canela, or cinnamon tea, since I was a kid. 
        <br>My mother always made it for us when we had a sore throat, a fever or just because. 
        <br>This cinnamon tea can be sweetened with honey, sugar, or piloncillo, which is Mexican brown sugar, 
        and we often added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.<br> 
        As adults the tea is spiked with pure cane alcohol, which is very common amongst Hispanic people.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 ½ sticks Ceylon cinnamon, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>Whatever choice of sweetener, such as honey, sugar, or piloncillo (optional)</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon lemon juice, or as needed (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place water and cinnamon sticks in a pot and bring to a boil. <br>Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. 
                <br>Strain tea and pour into a cup; add sweetener and lemon juice as desired.</li>       
        </ol>
